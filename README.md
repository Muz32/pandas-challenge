# pandas-challenge
In this assignment challenge, I utilized Pandas dataframes to analyse student performance across various schools within a local government area. The raw data included student math scores, reading scores, enrollment numbers, and total budget allocations for each school.

I created several dataframes based on calculations such as mean scores, passing rates, and per-student budgets for different schools. These dataframes facilitated comparisons and insights into performance trends among schools, ultimately leading to conclusions on ways to enhance standards in underperforming schools.

To explore the detailed analysis and conclusions, please refer to the Jupyter notebook file located in the PyCitySchools folder.

The data for this challenge was provided by edX bootcamps LLC.
