# pandas-challenge
In this assignment challenge, I used Pandas dataframes to analyze students' performances across various schools within a local government area. The raw data used in the analysis included student math scores, reading scores, student enrollment numbers, and the total budget allocations for each school.

I created various dataframes based on calculations such as mean scores, passing rates, and per-student budgets for different schools. These dataframes were instrumental in comparing and understanding performance trends among schools, leading to conclusions on ways to improve performance standards in underperforming schools.

The data for this challenge was provided by edX bootcamps LLC.
